Array = Ordered collection of elements under same data type
	- Memory is allocated contiguously
	- Advantages: fast access
	- Disadvantages: fixed in size; cannot add or remove
	
ArrayList = Ordered collection of elements under same data type
	- Unspecified size = size 10 (indexes 0-9)
	Empty ArrayList named "names" w/ unspecified size:
		- Capacity = 10
		- Size = 0
		- names.add("Mike") : size++; adds "Mike" to names[0]
		- If indexes 1,2,3 are occupied and you remove index 2, index 3 shifts to index 2
